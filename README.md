## Configure the sample code project 

Because this sample app requires camera access, you'll need to build and run this sample on a device. The first time you run this sample on device, you need to grant the app access to the camera.
In the sample project's `assets` folder, open the `sampleDocuments.png` file and use the rear camera on iPad or iPhone. Optionally, if you have access to a printer, print this file and try scanning it with your device.
